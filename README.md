# CPU-Scheduling-algorithms
CPU scheduling algorithms(Operating System) is implemented in C.
The code is dynamic i.e. the code reads the input from a file and gives the output in the form of gantt chart.

The algorithms implemented are:
1) FCFS - First Come First Served
2) SRTF - Shortest Running Time First
3) SJF - Shortest Job First
4) Priority Scheduling
5) LJF - Longest Job First
6) Round Robin Scheduing
